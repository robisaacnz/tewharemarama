    <h2>Te Whare Marama IT Improvement Plan</h2>

<p><em>draft document for discussion</em></p>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This plan lays out the steps we will take in 2014 to improve the IT infrastructure and related services at Te Whare Marama, for the benefit of both residents and staff.</p>

<p>The overarching goal is to establish refuge residents as first class Internet citizens, by removing barriers of cost, hardware, accessibility and expertise.</p>

<p>Cost is addressed by sponsored access provided for free.  Hardware is addressed through the refurbishment of donated computers.  Accessibility is addressed by making computers freely available to all residents.  Expertise is addressed through education, training and ongoing support.</p>

<p>The plan is divided into three sections:</p>

<p><strong>Ongoing goals:</strong> These form a continuous requirement, present throughout the year.  Volumes are estimates only, based on throughput of residents and community members.</p>

<p><strong>Operational improvements:</strong> These are the tasks that form the ongoing project work, to correct a fault, add new services or improve an existing service.</p>

<p><strong>Experimental projects:</strong> These are ideas worth testing, which we may or may not pursue in the future, depending on the results.  In general, these projects seek to apply the existing expertise of the refuge staff to digital applications.</p>

<h3>Ongoing goals</h3>

<p><strong>Computers for residents.</strong> Supply any resident who needs one with a current generation Windows computer with appropriate software for their permanent ownership and use.</p>

<p><strong>Phones for residents.</strong> Supply any resident who needs one with a cellphone and any necessary SIMs, accessories, etc.  Cycle SIMs as necessary to reduce harmful contact.</p>

<p><strong>Classes for residents.</strong> Ensure any resident who needs it has access to a computer for any of the online services used in any inhouse education programme, and that these computers are preconfigured with direct access to those services.</p>

<p><strong>Community support.</strong> Provide needed equipment such as phones to members of the community with a relationship to the refuge.</p>


<h3>Operational improvements</h3>

<p><strong>Upgrade staff equipment.</strong> Equip all the staff with modern laptops, smartphones and software in accordance with their needs.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrade Internet access.</strong> Get sponsorship for a high speed Internet connection at no cost, and cancel the old Internet service.</p>

<p><strong>Improve Wi-Fi.</strong> Install a wireless Internet network capable of supporting simultaneous use by all residents, and run cables to access points in areas of poor reception throughout the premises.</p>

<p><strong>Create an acceptable use policy.</strong> Write a suitable agreement document for resident use of the local network and Internet connection, and get buy-in from the current residents.</p>

<p><strong>Improve network security.</strong> Retire the unsecured Windows file server and move confidential documents to an online service with strict access controls and automated backups.</p>

<p><strong>Improve operational security.</strong> Ensure confidential documents cannot be retrieved from staff laptops if lost or stolen.  Implement encryption and related policies where necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Register a domain name.</strong> Get sponsorship for a domain name registration and register <em>tewharemarama.org.nz</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Set up email and other services.</strong> Obtain a Google Apps for Non Profits account, delegate <em>tewharemarama.org.nz</em> to it, and create email accounts for all staff members.</p>

<p><strong>Preserve old contact addresses.</strong> Set up an automated reply and retrieval system to continue clearing the old email address and alerting correspondents to the address change.  Cancel the old address at some point in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Create a central contact point for services.</strong>  Set up an email address for registration with online services, and arrange for this address to be monitored by the appropriate staff members.</p>

<p><strong>Improve document sharing.</strong> Create accounts and configure an online document sharing service such as  OneDrive or Dropbox and set it up for all staff to use instead of the local file sharing.</p>

<p><strong>Engage graphic designer.</strong> Collect examples of collateral published in house and write a brief for a graphic designer to develop a consistent logo and visual identity for use in this work and on the web.</p>

<p><strong>Publish a web site.</strong> Combine the material on courses and services offered with basic contact information to publish a simple web site using the branding above. </p>

<p><strong>Retire obsolete computers.</strong> Remove older hardware from operational roles, securely erase any confidential data, and refurbish these systems for any appropriate community roles.</p>

<p><strong>Improve entertainment options.</strong> Install a PVR in the lounge with access to recorded educational and entertainment TV suitable for children.</p>

<p><strong>Prepare as-built documentation.</strong> Create a single document that includes access and management details for all required services, and store this document securely for use in an emergency, such as in an envelope at the Mangere Law Centre.</p>


<h3>Experimental projects</h3>

<p>These projects are all experimental, and may be cancelled if the results or feedback from the community is not positive.</p>

<p><strong>Lending library.</strong> Collect donated equipment such as tablet computers, game devices, cameras and e-readers. These items remain the property of the refuge, but are made available to residents use via a lending library.</p>

<p><strong>Webmail provider.</strong> To effectively use the services provided, residents require a stable email address they can reliably access.  Many people simply create a new Gmail account whenever anything asks for one, and rarely retain access to any more than the last couple.  We will trial the provision of stable, long-term email addresses, for use in seeking housing, jobs and so on.</p>

<p><strong>Laptops on the premises.</strong> Reserve six donated computers, ideally small lightweight systems like netbooks, and assign them to each room as a computer that belongs to the refuge and remains on the premises for use by residents.  Preload these laptops with direct access to basic resources (Facebook, etc.) as well as the online services used by the refuge in classes and support.  Set them up to preserve the privacy of multiple concurrent users, and maintain a standby stock of parts and spares.</p>

<p><strong>Chrome apps.</strong> Refuge staff have a number of online resources that are heavily used to support residents.  Package these resources as Chrome apps, and put them in the Chrome app store for ease of cross-platform use across Chrome OS and Windows, along with some other basic New Zealand services that are not currently available.  Use the Chrome management tools in conjunction with the Google Apps for Non Profits domain and the webmail provider to push these apps to the accounts used on the inhouse netbooks or established for residents.</p>
